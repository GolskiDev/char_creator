# Main Objectives

## User Creating character however he wants
User should be able to start creating his character with different approaches.
- I decided that user can create an empty character with level without putting his levels into any of the classes
  - It is also usefull when user is using a class out of the premade classes
- Setting custom max hp, adding different things manually should be suppported and later user can add the details

# 5e implementation
### If we multiclass we need to know for which class spell is prepared because we would like to know which ability score to use
