# Main Objectives

## User Creating character however he wants
User should be able to start creating his character with different approaches.
- I decided that user can create an empty character with level without putting his levels into any of the classes
  - It is also usefull when user is using a class out of the premade classes
- Setting custom max hp, adding different things manually should be suppported and later user can add the details

# 5e implementation
### If we multiclass we need to know from where we know spell (which class) because we would like to know which ability score to use
- we also need to know this, because if we have the same spell from different sources, and we want to delete it (from known or prepared), then we need to know from where to delete it
