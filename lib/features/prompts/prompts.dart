The character should have prominent accessories such as describe accessories, and the shoulders and chest should be included for a more full-body feel. The overall mood should reflect the character's class and race, with high contrast and highly detailed features. Use sharp, defined lines for the features, and maintain a mature or middle-aged appearance. The artwork should have minimal brushstrokes, keeping the lines neat and simple, resembling a digital sketch or vector art style. The character should be depicted in monochromatic black, with varying shades of one color for contrast. The background should be white, with the character fully visible within the frameâ€”make sure the entire portrait, including the head, shoulders, and chest, is included and not cropped. The lighting should be even, with no strong shadows, and the character should be centered with breathing space around them. Centered Composition. Medium Shot''',
